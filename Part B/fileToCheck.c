/**
* This is a test program for the second part of the Compiler's Project where we
* had to extend our compiler with for loops as well as accepting float numbers.
* Also our grammar had to accept symbols such as ++, --, -= and +=. 
* We had to implement a symbol table and find errors like the ones below. Also,
* we had to implement type checking and print the message if an error was presented.
